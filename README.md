# Lab.js-builder-standalone

This repsository contains a standalone version of [Lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) Builder. It lets you use the Builder on your own computer without connecting the lab.js server. This may be convenient if you have to work on your experiment without an internet connection. 

## How to use the stadalone lab.js builder
To use the standalone lab.js builder, download `lab.js builder.zip` on your Windows PC and unzip in a folder. Then, simply run the exe file `run_builder.exe` in the folder. The Builer will starts shortly in your default browser. 

>Note that the `labjs-builder-standalone` folder must be located in the same folder as the exe file. The exe file will opens two new windows, a command prompt that will start something called 'local server' in your computer, and your default browser that accesses the local server and hosts the builder.

## How to close the standalone lab.js builder
To close the standalone lab.js builder, just close both the browser and the command prompt. Closing the browser does not kill the local server, you can open a new browser window and type `localhost:8000` will  start the lab.js builder again. If you only close the command prompt, the Builder will stil be running on the browser until you close the browser.

## The original script
The original script is written in Python, and it is included in the depository `run_builder.py`. You can also run the script if Python is installed in your computer. It is compatible with Python3.

## Updating Builder version
The Builder in this repository is Version 20.1.1. This is the latest version as of September 2020. The version may not be updated in this repository, but you can create the latest version of the Builder standalone by replacing the `labjs-builder-standalone` folder. This requires a bit of work. Namely, you need to create a local copy of the builder by following [this procedure](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute/build.html). I got quite a few errors in the process and work along problems. But if successful, you will have a folder containing `packages/builder/build`. Replace the `labjs-builder-standalone` folder with the `packages/builder/build` folder. The exec file (and Python script) should still work with the new version.
